> **Note**: This project is developed through human-AI collaboration. Most of the code is written and maintained by AI, orchestrated under human guidance and oversight by experienced programmers.

## How It Works & Features

Transform your mobile device into a comprehensive telemetry system for Airsoft gameplay with these core capabilities:

- **üéØ Session Management**: Start tracking and the app begins collecting GPS location at configurable intervals (1-60 seconds) with complete start/pause/resume/stop workflow
- **üìç Event Recording**: Tap HIT, SPAWN, or KILL buttons to log combat events with precise coordinates, plus automatic session events 
- **üìä Data Analysis**: View real-time data and receive AI-powered analysis and recommendations for better gameplay (in development)
- **üíæ Local Storage**: SQLite database stores all telemetry data locally with CSV export functionality
- **üñ•Ô∏è Modern Interface**: Dark theme optimized for outdoor gaming with intuitive controls and real-time feedback
- **üîí Privacy First**: No backend required - all data stored locally on your device (except optional AI analysis)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK 3.4.3 or higher
- Dart SDK 3.0 or higher
- Android Studio or VS Code with Flutter extensions
- Physical device for GPS testing (emulator GPS simulation is unreliable)

### Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xmbn/Airsoft-Telemetry.git
   cd Airsoft-Telemetry
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
